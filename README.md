MATLAB implementation of position control of differential robots

A differential robot is a mobile robot designed to move in a particular direction by using two independently driven wheels or tracks. These robots are equipped with sensors and control systems that allow them to navigate and navigate around obstacles in their environment. Differential robots are often used in applications such as material handling, inspection, and mapping, as they are able to move smoothly and accurately over a variety of surfaces.
